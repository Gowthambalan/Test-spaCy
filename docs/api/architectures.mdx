A **model architecture** is a function that wires up a
[`Model`](https://thinc.ai/docs/api-model) instance, which you can then use in a
pipeline component or as a layer of a larger network. This page documents
spaCy's built-in architectures that are used for different NLP tasks. All
trainable [built-in components](/api#architecture-pipeline) expect a `model`
argument defined in the config and document their the default architecture.
Custom architectures can be registered using the
[`@spacy.registry.architectures`](/api/top-level#registry) decorator and used as
part of the [training config](/usage/training#custom-functions). Also see the
usage documentation on
[layers and model architectures](/usage/layers-architectures).

Build spaCy's "standard" tok2vec layer. This layer is defined by a
[MultiHashEmbed](/api/architectures#MultiHashEmbed) embedding layer that uses
subword features, and a
[MaxoutWindowEncoder](/api/architectures#MaxoutWindowEncoder) encoding layer
consisting of a CNN and a layer-normalized maxout activation function.

| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `width`              | The width of the input and output. These are required to be the same, so that residual connections can be used. Recommended values are `96`, `128` or `300`. ~~int~~                                                                                                          |
| `depth`              | The number of convolutional layers to use. Recommended values are between `2` and `8`. ~~int~~                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `embed_size`         | The number of rows in the hash embedding tables. This can be surprisingly small, due to the use of the hash embeddings. Recommended values are between `2000` and `10000`. ~~int~~                                                                                            |
| `window_size`        | The number of tokens on either side to concatenate during the convolutions. The receptive field of the CNN will be `depth * (window_size * 2 + 1)`, so a 4-layer network with a window size of `2` will be sensitive to 20 words at a time. Recommended value is `1`. ~~int~~ |
| `maxout_pieces`      | The number of pieces to use in the maxout non-linearity. If `1`, the [`Mish`](https://thinc.ai/docs/api-layers#mish) non-linearity is used instead. Recommended values are `1`-`3`. ~~int~~                                                                                   |
| `subword_features`   | Whether to also embed subword features, specifically the prefix, suffix and word shape. This is recommended for alphabetic languages like English, but not if single-character tokens are used for a language such as Chinese. ~~bool~~                                       |
| `pretrained_vectors` | Whether to also use static vectors. ~~bool~~                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

A listener is used as a sublayer within a component such as a
[`DependencyParser`](/api/dependencyparser),
[`EntityRecognizer`](/api/entityrecognizer)or
[`TextCategorizer`](/api/textcategorizer). Usually you'll have multiple
listeners connecting to a single upstream [`Tok2Vec`](/api/tok2vec) component
that's earlier in the pipeline. The listener layers act as **proxies**, passing
the predictions from the `Tok2Vec` component into downstream components, and
communicating gradients back upstream.

Instead of defining its own `Tok2Vec` instance, a model architecture like
[Tagger](/api/architectures#tagger) can define a listener as its `tok2vec`
argument that connects to the shared `tok2vec` component in the pipeline.

Listeners work by caching the `Tok2Vec` output for a given batch of `Doc`s. This
means that in order for a component to work with the listener, the batch of
`Doc`s passed to the listener must be the same as the batch of `Doc`s passed to
the `Tok2Vec`. As a result, any manipulation of the `Doc`s which would affect
`Tok2Vec` output, such as to create special contexts or remove `Doc`s for which
no prediction can be made, must happen inside the model, **after** the call to
the `Tok2Vec` component.

| `upstream`  | A string to identify the "upstream" `Tok2Vec` component to communicate with. By default, the upstream name is the wildcard string `"*"`, but you could also specify the name of the `Tok2Vec` component. You'll almost never have multiple upstream `Tok2Vec` components, so the wildcard string will almost always be fine. ~~str~~ |

Construct an embedding layer that separately embeds a number of lexical
attributes using hash embedding, concatenates the results, and passes it through
a feed-forward subnetwork to build a mixed representation. The features used can
be configured with the `attrs` argument. The suggested attributes are `NORM`,
`PREFIX`, `SUFFIX` and `SHAPE`. This lets the model take into account some
subword information, without construction a fully character-based
representation. If pretrained vectors are available, they can be included in the
representation as well, with the vectors table kept static (i.e. it's not
updated).

| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `width`                  | The output width. Also used as the width of the embedding tables. Recommended values are between `64` and `300`. If static vectors are included, a learned linear layer is used to map the vectors to the specified width before concatenating it with the other embedding outputs. A single maxout layer is then used to reduce the concatenated vectors to the final width. ~~int~~                                                              |
| `attrs`                  | The token attributes to embed. A separate embedding table will be constructed for each attribute. ~~List[Union[int, str]]~~                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `rows`                   | The number of rows for each embedding tables. Can be low, due to the hashing trick. Recommended values are between `1000` and `10000`. The layer needs surprisingly few rows, due to its use of the hashing trick. Generally between 2000 and 10000 rows is sufficient, even for very large vocabularies. A number of rows must be specified for each table, so the `rows` list must be of the same length as the `attrs` parameter. ~~List[int]~~ |
| `include_static_vectors` | Whether to also use static word vectors. Requires a vectors table to be loaded in the [`Doc`](/api/doc) objects' vocab. ~~bool~~                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Construct an embedded representation based on character embeddings, using a
feed-forward network. A fixed number of UTF-8 byte characters are used for each
word, taken from the beginning and end of the word equally. Padding is used in
the center for words that are too short.

For instance, let's say `nC=4`, and the word is "jumping". The characters used
will be `"jung"` (two from the start, two from the end). If we had `nC=8`, the
characters would be `"jumpping"`: 4 from the start, 4 from the end. This ensures
that the final character is always in the last position, instead of being in an
arbitrary position depending on the word length.

The characters are embedded in a embedding table with a given number of rows,
and the vectors concatenated. A hash-embedded vector of the `NORM` of the word
is also concatenated on, and the result is then passed through a feed-forward
network to construct a single vector to represent the information.

Load and wrap a transformer model from the
[HuggingFace `transformers`](https://huggingface.co/transformers) library. You
can use any transformer that has pretrained weights and a PyTorch
implementation. The `name` variable is passed through to the underlying library,
so it can be either a string or a path. If it's a string, the pretrained weights
will be downloaded via the transformers library if they are not already
available locally.

In order to support longer documents, the
[TransformerModel](/api/architectures#TransformerModel) layer allows you to pass
in a `get_spans` function that will divide up the [`Doc`](/api/doc) objects
before passing them through the transformer. Your spans are allowed to overlap
or exclude tokens. This layer is usually used directly by the
[`Transformer`](/api/transformer) component, which allows you to share the
transformer weights across your pipeline. For a layer that's configured for use
in other components, see
[Tok2VecTransformer](/api/architectures#Tok2VecTransformer).

Create a `TransformerListener` layer, which will connect to a
[`Transformer`](/api/transformer) component earlier in the pipeline. The layer
takes a list of [`Doc`](/api/doc) objects as input, and produces a list of
2-dimensional arrays as output, with each array having one row per token. Most
spaCy models expect a sublayer with this signature, making it easy to connect
them to a transformer model via this sublayer. Transformer models usually
operate over wordpieces, which usually don't align one-to-one against spaCy
tokens. The layer therefore requires a reduction operation in order to calculate
a single token vector given zero or more wordpiece vectors.

| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `pooling`     | A reduction layer used to calculate the token vectors based on zero or more wordpiece vectors. If in doubt, mean pooling (see [`reduce_mean`](https://thinc.ai/docs/api-layers#reduce_mean)) is usually a good choice. ~~Model[Ragged, Floats2d]~~                                                                                               |
| `grad_factor` | Reweight gradients from the component before passing them upstream. You can set this to `0` to "freeze" the transformer weights with respect to the component, or use it to make some components more significant than others. Leaving it at `1.0` is usually fine. ~~float~~                                                                    |
| `upstream`    | A string to identify the "upstream" `Transformer` component to communicate with. By default, the upstream name is the wildcard string `"*"`, but you could also specify the name of the `Transformer` component. You'll almost never have multiple upstream `Transformer` components, so the wildcard string will almost always be fine. ~~str~~ |

Use a transformer as a [`Tok2Vec`](/api/tok2vec) layer directly. This does
**not** allow multiple components to share the transformer weights and does
**not** allow the transformer to set annotations into the [`Doc`](/api/doc)

## Pretraining architectures {id="pretrain",source="spacy/ml/models/multi_task.py"}

The spacy `pretrain` command lets you initialize a `Tok2Vec` layer in your
pipeline with information from raw text. To this end, additional layers are
added to build a network for a temporary task that forces the `Tok2Vec` layer to
learn something about sentence structure and word cooccurrence statistics. Two
pretraining objectives are available, both of which are variants of the cloze
task [Devlin et al. (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) introduced for
BERT.

For more information, see the section on
[pretraining](/usage/embeddings-transformers#pretraining).

### spacy.PretrainVectors.v1 {id="pretrain_vectors"}

Predict the word's vector from a static embeddings table as pretraining
objective for a Tok2Vec layer. To use this objective, make sure that the
`initialize.vectors` section in the config refers to a model with static
vectors.

Build a transition-based parser model. Can apply to NER or dependency parsing.
Transition-based parsing is an approach to structured prediction where the task
of predicting the structure is mapped to a series of state transitions. You
might find [this tutorial](https://explosion.ai/blog/parsing-english-in-python)
helpful for background information. The neural network state prediction model
consists of either two or three subnetworks:

- **tok2vec**: Map each token into a vector representation. This subnetwork is
  run once for each batch.
- **lower**: Construct a feature-specific vector for each `(token, feature)`
  pair. This is also run once for each batch. Constructing the state
  representation is then a matter of summing the component features and applying
  the non-linearity.
- **upper** (optional): A feed-forward network that predicts scores from the
  state representation. If not present, the output from the lower model is used
  as action scores directly.

## Text classification architectures {id="textcat",source="spacy/ml/models/textcat.py"}

A text classification architecture needs to take a [`Doc`](/api/doc) as input,
and produce a score for each potential label class. Textcat challenges can be
binary (e.g. sentiment analysis) or involve multiple possible labels.
Multi-label challenges can either have mutually exclusive labels (each example
has exactly one label), or multiple labels may be applicable at the same time.

As the properties of text classification problems can vary widely, we provide
several different built-in architectures. It is recommended to experiment with
different architectures and settings to determine what works best on your
specific data and challenge.

<Infobox title="Single-label vs. multi-label classification" variant="warning">

When the architecture for a text classification challenge contains a setting for
`exclusive_classes`, it is important to use the correct value for the correct
pipeline component. The `textcat` component should always be used for
single-label use-cases where `exclusive_classes = true`, while the
`textcat_multilabel` should be used for multi-label settings with
`exclusive_classes = false`.

Stacked ensemble of a linear bag-of-words model and a neural network model. The
neural network is built upon a Tok2Vec layer and uses attention. The setting for
whether or not this model should cater for multi-label classification, is taken
from the linear model, where it is stored in `model.attrs["multi_label"]`.

## Entity linking architectures {id="entitylinker",source="spacy/ml/models/entity_linker.py"}

An [`EntityLinker`](/api/entitylinker) component disambiguates textual mentions
(tagged as named entities) to unique identifiers, grounding the named entities
into the "real world". This requires 3 main components:

- A [`KnowledgeBase`](/api/kb) (KB) holding the unique identifiers, potential
  synonyms and prior probabilities.
- A candidate generation step to produce a set of likely identifiers, given a
  certain textual mention.
- A machine learning [`Model`](https://thinc.ai/docs/api-model) that picks the
  most plausible ID from the set of candidates.

### spacy.EntityLinker.v2 {id="EntityLinker"}

> #### Example Config
>
> ```ini
> [model]
> @architectures = "spacy.EntityLinker.v2"
> nO = null
>
> [model.tok2vec]
> @architectures = "spacy.HashEmbedCNN.v2"
> pretrained_vectors = null
> width = 96
> depth = 2
> embed_size = 2000
> window_size = 1
> maxout_pieces = 3
> subword_features = true
> ```

The `EntityLinker` model architecture is a Thinc `Model` with a
[`Linear`](https://thinc.ai/api-layers#linear) output layer.

| `entity_vector_length` | The length of the vectors encoding each entity in the KB. Defaults to `64`. ~~int~~ |

### spacy.EmptyKB.v2 {id="EmptyKB"}

A function that creates an empty `KnowledgeBase` from a [`Vocab`](/api/vocab)
instance. This is the default when a new entity linker component is created. It
returns a `Callable[[Vocab, int], InMemoryLookupKB]`.

### spacy.KBFromFile.v1 {id="KBFromFile"}

A function that reads an existing `KnowledgeBase` from file.

| Name      | Description                                              |

### spacy.CandidateGenerator.v1 {id="CandidateGenerator"}

A function that takes as input a [`KnowledgeBase`](/api/kb) and a
[`Span`](/api/span) object denoting a named entity, and returns a list of
plausible [`Candidate`](/api/kb/#candidate) objects. The default
`CandidateGenerator` uses the text of a mention to find its potential aliases in
the `KnowledgeBase`. Note that this function is case-dependent.

### spacy.CandidateBatchGenerator.v1 {id="CandidateBatchGenerator"}

A function that takes as input a [`KnowledgeBase`](/api/kb) and an `Iterable` of
[`Span`](/api/span) objects denoting named entities, and returns a list of
plausible [`Candidate`](/api/kb/#candidate) objects per specified
[`Span`](/api/span). The default `CandidateBatchGenerator` uses the text of a
mention to find its potential aliases in the `KnowledgeBase`. Note that this
function is case-dependent.

## Coreference {id="coref-architectures",tag="experimental"}

A [`CoreferenceResolver`](/api/coref) component identifies tokens that refer to
the same entity. A [`SpanResolver`](/api/span-resolver) component infers spans
from single tokens. Together these components can be used to reproduce
traditional coreference models. You can also omit the `SpanResolver` if working
with only token-level clusters is acceptable.

### spacy-experimental.Coref.v1 {id="Coref",tag="experimental"}
